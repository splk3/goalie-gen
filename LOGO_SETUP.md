# Adding Logo and Favicon Assets

## Overview

The code infrastructure for displaying logos and favicons has been set up, but placeholder images need to be replaced with the actual assets from the GitHub issue.

## Quick Setup (Automated)

### Option 1: Run the Download Script (Recommended)

We've provided a script to download all assets automatically. Run this from your local machine (not in the CI environment):

```bash
bash download-assets.sh
```

This will:
- Download all 4 logo variants
- Download and extract favicon files
- Place everything in the correct directories

After running the script:
```bash
npm run clean       # Clear Gatsby cache
npm run develop     # Start development server
```

### Option 2: Manual Download

If the script doesn't work on your system, follow the manual instructions below.

## Manual Setup Instructions

### 1. Download Logo Files

Download the following images from the GitHub issue and save them with these exact filenames:

#### Full Logos (for header)
- **Dark Mode Logo**: https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f726d0dd-3f09-41c7-83eb-f0168dcd956e
  - Save as: `static/images/logo-dark.png`
  - Description: White goalie with net and "GOALIE GEN DEVELOPMENT PLANS" text on transparent background

- **Light Mode Logo**: https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc61a67e-ccf2-43e0-aee0-d5937b8cc60e
  - Save as: `static/images/logo-light.png`
  - Description: Blue/red goalie with net and "GOALIE GEN DEVELOPMENT PLANS" text on transparent background

#### Alternate Logos (for favicons and icons)
- **Dark Mode Alternate**: https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e80a3a04-7b54-467c-94fb-e7d546e15cae
  - Save as: `static/images/logo-alt-dark.png`
  - Description: White gear with "GG" letters on transparent background

- **Light Mode Alternate**: https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1d98209-857a-4e62-9d92-bef18268c297
  - Save as: `static/images/logo-alt-light.png`
  - Description: Red/blue gear with "GG" letters on transparent background

### 2. Download and Extract Favicon Files

#### Light Mode Favicons
1. Download: https://github.com/user-attachments/files/24362453/gg-favicon.zip
2. Extract the zip file
3. Copy `favicon.ico` from the zip to `static/favicon.ico` (replace existing placeholder)
4. **Optional**: Copy other favicon sizes to `static/favicons/` if you want multiple sizes

#### Dark Mode Favicons
1. Download: https://github.com/user-attachments/files/24362454/gg-favicon-darkmode.zip
2. Extract the zip file
3. **Optional**: These can be used for dark mode favicon support (advanced setup)

## File Structure After Adding Assets

```
static/
├── favicon.ico                          # Main favicon (from light mode zip)
├── images/
│   ├── logo-dark.png                   # Full dark mode logo
│   ├── logo-light.png                  # Full light mode logo
│   ├── logo-alt-dark.png               # Alternate dark mode logo
│   ├── logo-alt-light.png              # Alternate light mode logo
│   └── README.md                        # Instructions
└── favicons/
    └── README.md                        # Instructions
```

## How It Works

### Logo Component
- The `Logo` component (`src/components/Logo.js`) automatically switches between light and dark mode logos
- Uses the HTML `<picture>` element with media queries
- Dark mode logo shows when user's system is in dark mode
- Light mode logo shows by default
- Supports both SVG and PNG formats via the `format` prop (defaults to 'svg')

### Header Usage
- The main header in `src/pages/index.js` displays the full logo
- Logo replaces the previous text-based "Goalie Gen" title
- Logo automatically adapts to the current color scheme
- **After downloading PNG files**: Update the Logo component to use `format="png"` prop:
  ```jsx
  <Logo variant="full" width={300} height={150} format="png" />
  ```

### Favicons
- Main favicon.ico is loaded from `static/favicon.ico`
- Additional favicon sizes are generated by `gatsby-plugin-manifest`
- Uses the alternate logo (gear with GG) as the icon source
- PWA manifest is configured for installable web app support

## Testing

After adding the actual image files:

1. Run `npm run clean` to clear Gatsby cache
2. Run `npm run develop` to start the development server
3. Check that:
   - Logo displays in the header
   - Logo switches between light/dark variants when toggling dark mode
   - Favicon appears in the browser tab
   - No console errors about missing images

## Build and Deploy

Once images are in place:

```bash
npm run build        # Build the site
npm run deploy       # Deploy to GitHub Pages
```

The deployment will automatically include all static assets.
